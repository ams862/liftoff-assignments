### Overview
My app will provide Rugby players the abiliaty to connect with others in their community as well as all over the world. It will connect players who plan to be attending the same tournaments and events. This app will also give the rugby community the oppertunity to come together and unite to further the sport as a whole. This app will allow players to post information as well as offer up their homes as a place to stay for other players. In the rugby culture it is very common for visiting teams to stay with the home team. After matches teams will go out to eat and drink together (hosted by the home team). The idea of rugby is an idea of family. You do not just compete against these other athlete, but you become friends as well. This app will make that relationship easier and help unite the community as a whole.
